Tic Tac Toe Web Game

This project is a Tic Tac Toe web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a beautiful UI design and provides a smooth platform for users to play the game.

Skills Utilized

In this project, I have utilized the following skills:

1. HTML: The game board and user interface elements are built using HTML. HTML provides the structure and layout of the game, allowing for easy navigation and interaction.

2. CSS: I have used CSS to style the game and create an attractive UI design. CSS allows for customization of colors, fonts, and visual elements, enhancing the overall user experience.

3. JavaScript: The game logic and functionality are implemented using JavaScript. JavaScript enables dynamic behavior, allowing users to interact with the game, make moves, and determine the winner.

4. Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users can enjoy the game seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. Event Handling: I have used event handling techniques in JavaScript to capture user inputs and trigger appropriate actions. This enables users to click on the game board, select their moves, and see the game progress in real-time.

6. DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is leveraged to dynamically update the game board and display messages to the user. DOM manipulation allows for seamless rendering of game states and updates during gameplay.

7. Game Logic: I have implemented the necessary logic to handle player turns, validate moves, check for a winning condition, and declare a winner. This ensures that the game behaves correctly and provides an enjoyable gaming experience.
